## 🧠 Sales Forecasting Using Machine Learning

This project focuses on predicting future sales using various machine learning regression models. It utilizes historical sales data and related features to forecast future trends, enabling better business planning and decision-making.

## 📁 Project Structure

1. **Data Loading and Exploration:**  
   The dataset is loaded and explored to understand trends, patterns, and outliers. Visualizations and descriptive statistics help identify the structure and characteristics of the data.

2. **Data Preprocessing:**  
   This includes handling missing values, converting date columns, encoding categorical variables (if any), and scaling numeric features to prepare the data for machine learning models.

3. **Feature Engineering:**  
   Additional features like lag variables, rolling averages, and date-based components (day, month, year) are generated to improve model performance.

4. **Model Training and Evaluation:**  
   Multiple regression models are trained and tested. Their performance is assessed using metrics such as Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Mean Squared Error (MSE), and R² score.

5. **Hyperparameter Tuning:**  
   GridSearchCV or similar methods are used to optimize model performance by fine-tuning key hyperparameters.

## 📊 Data

The dataset used in this project is assumed to be stored in a file named `sales_data.csv`. The dataset may include the following columns:

- `date`: Date of the transaction  
- `store`: Store identifier  
- `item`: Item identifier  
- `sales`: Number of items sold  
- *(Additional columns depending on the dataset, such as promotions, holidays, etc.)*

## 📈 Results

The notebook evaluates several machine learning regression models, including:

- Linear Regression  
- Decision Tree Regressor  
- Random Forest Regressor  
- Gradient Boosting Regressor  
- XGBoost Regressor  
- LightGBM Regressor  

Each model’s performance is compared using metrics like:

- Mean Absolute Error (MAE)  
- Mean Squared Error (MSE)  
- Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)  
- R² Score

Visual comparisons of actual vs. predicted sales are also provided to demonstrate model accuracy.
